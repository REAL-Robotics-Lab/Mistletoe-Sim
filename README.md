# Mistletoe-Sim

Simualtion environments for the Mistletoe Quadruped platform.  
Environments are used for training the control policies for Mistletoe, using reinforcement learning.   

## Running the Simulation

Simulation environments require Nvidia Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab to run.  
Installation steps can be found at [this link](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/setup/installation/index.html).  

After cloning the repository with  
`git clone https://github.com/REAL-Robotics-Lab/Mistletoe-Sim`  
you can insert the files into your clone of Isaac Lab, inside of  
`source/extensions/omni.isaac.lab_tasks/omni/isaac/lab_tasks/manager_based/locomotion/velocity/config/mistletoe`.  

This is a temporary solution until the Nvidia team releases their extension template to the public.
